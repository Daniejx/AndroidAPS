# Project Preferences

## Token Usage Reduction (Delay Conversation Compaction)

- **Use Task agents for exploration instead of direct Glob/Grep:**
    - `Task tool with subagent_type=Explore` summarizes findings
    - Direct Glob/Grep returns raw content which consumes more tokens
- **Limit file reads:**
    - Use `limit` parameter (100-200 lines) for large files
    - Use `offset` to target specific sections you need
    - Don't re-read files already seen in conversation
- **Use efficient Grep modes:**
    - `output_mode: "files_with_matches"` (default) - just file paths
    - `output_mode: "count"` - just counts
    - Only use `"content"` when you need actual line content
    - Use `head_limit` to cap number of results
- **Suppress verbose Bash output:**
    - Use `--quiet` flag for gradle: `.\gradlew.bat assembleFullDebug --quiet --no-daemon`
    - Pipe to `tail -50` for long outputs
    - Avoid commands that dump entire logs
- **Be specific in searches:**
    - Narrow glob patterns: `src/**/specific/*.kt` instead of `**/*.kt`
    - Precise regex patterns to reduce false matches
- **Avoid redundant operations:**
    - Reference line numbers from memory instead of re-reading
    - Don't explore same directories multiple times
    - Combine related searches when possible

## User Preferences

- **When user says "ALL":**
    - Do NOT optimize, batch, summarize, or take shortcuts
    - Create a todo item for EVERY item/file to be processed
    - Process each item individually and mark complete only after fully done
    - After each batch, state how many remain and continue until zero remain
    - Do NOT stop early or claim "done" until truly everything is processed
    - User WILL verify results - assume accountability
- **Always use explicit imports:**
    - Never use fully qualified names (e.g., `kotlin.math.abs`)
    - Always add proper import statements at the top of the file
    - Example: Add `import kotlin.math.abs` instead of using `kotlin.math.abs()`
- **Use centralized theme/styling:**
    - For Compose UI: Always use theme values instead of hardcoded dp/padding/colors. If proper
      setting doesn't exist, discuss it before creating hardcoded values.
    - If hardcoded values exist, consider moving them to theme for consistency and maintainability
- **Type safety principles:**
    - Prefer specific types over `Any?` whenever possible
    - Document why `Any?` is used if it's truly necessary (e.g., module boundary constraints)
- **Systematic cleanup after migrations:**
    - Remove unused functions, parameters, and extensions
    - Delete deprecated code and escape hatches
    - Compile frequently to verify nothing breaks
- **Use TodoWrite for complex multi-step work:**
    - Create specific, actionable todo items (not vague descriptions)
    - Mark todos in_progress before starting, completed immediately after finishing
    - Keep exactly ONE todo in_progress at a time
    - Break down large tasks into smaller items for tracking
- **IMPORTANT: Read `.claude/CLAUDE_COMMANDS.md` at conversation start and after compaction** -
  Contains working commands for this local system
- **Update `.claude/CLAUDE_COMMANDS.md` continuously** - When discovering new working commands,
  useful patterns, or fixes for broken commands, add them to the file immediately
- On KSP error during compilation just compile again. Do not clean build.
- On file locked error stop gradle daemons
- Never install app automatically
- Use %TEMP% directory for screenshots
- Can edit files and run commands freely without asking for permission
- Can use internet/web search as needed
- For compilation do not use gradle daemon
- Avoid duplication while writing new code and resources. Prefer moving to another module. Elaborate
  if you think, it's necessary
- When resource strings are affected, change only english version. Ignore translations
- **Avoid adding new module dependencies** - Adding dependencies between modules can significantly
  slow down compilation time. Always discuss before adding dependencies. Prefer alternatives:
    - Inline constants instead of importing from another module
    - Move shared code to existing common modules
    - Use interfaces defined in core modules

## Migration Procedures

When performing large-scale code migrations (e.g., XML→Compose, old API→new API):

### Planning Phase

- **Create a PLAN.md file** to track the entire migration
    - List all phases (Phase 0: Prerequisites, Phase 1-N: Implementation, Final: Cleanup)
    - Identify and categorize files by complexity (simple → medium → complex)
    - Track file counts and status for each phase
    - Update plan as you learn new information
- **Use grep/glob extensively** to find ALL instances before starting
    - Search for old patterns to ensure nothing is missed
    - Count total files/instances that need migration
    - Re-verify counts at the end

### Migration Strategy

- **Migrate in phases, simple to complex:**
    - Phase 0: Build prerequisites (base classes, shared code, utilities)
    - Phase 1: Simple cases with clear patterns
    - Phase 2: Medium complexity
    - Phase 3: Complex cases, special handling
    - Phase 4: Base classes that affect multiple files
    - Final Phase: Cleanup and remove old code
- **Identify base classes early:**
    - Changes to base classes affect many subclasses
    - Migrate base classes in dedicated phase
    - Update all subclasses together to avoid compilation errors
- **Maintain backward compatibility during migration:**
    - Keep both old and new code paths working
    - Mark old code as `@Deprecated` but don't remove yet
    - Only remove deprecated code when migration is 100% complete
    - Test that both paths work during transition

### Execution Phase

- **Migrate in batches, compile frequently:**
    - Don't batch too many changes before compiling
    - Compile after each phase or every 5-10 files
    - Fix compilation errors immediately
    - Use TodoWrite to track progress within each phase
- **Verify completeness rigorously:**
    - After claiming a phase is "done", search for old patterns
    - Count migrated files vs. initial count
    - User will verify - assume accountability
- **Document decisions in PLAN.md:**
    - Why certain approaches were chosen
    - What patterns emerged during migration
    - What issues were encountered and how solved

### Cleanup Phase (Only After 100% Migration Complete)

- **Systematic cleanup in specific order:**
    1. Remove `@Deprecated` markers and deprecated functions
    2. Delete unused extensions and helper functions
    3. Remove escape hatches and fallback code paths
    4. Delete unused parameters from interfaces/classes
    5. Replace generic types (`Any?`) with specific types
    6. Consolidate to single code path (remove if/else for old vs. new)
    7. Move hardcoded values to centralized theme/config
    8. Delete completely unused files
- **Verify after each cleanup step:**
    - Compile after each type of cleanup
    - Don't batch all cleanup before compiling
- **Update documentation:**
    - Remove TODOs referencing old code
    - Update comments to reflect new approach
    - Archive or delete PLAN.md if no longer needed

### Key Principles

- **Never claim "done" prematurely** - user will verify
- **Keep PLAN.md as single source of truth** for migration status
- **Compile frequently** - catch errors early
- **Cleanup only at the end** - don't mix migration with cleanup
